##### Empowering Water Science Research Through Collaboration

WaterSoftHack is a multi-year NSF-funded project, dedicated to advancing water science research and education through the synergistic power of cyberinfrastructure (CI) and machine learning training. This initiative is a collaborative effort led by Dr. Vidya Samadi from Clemson University, collaboratively with the University of Iowa and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI).

##### Our Vision

The vision of WaterSoftHack is to democratize access to advanced CI approaches and cybertraining materials within the water science community. The goal is to foster an inclusive academic environment that encourages exploration and innovation and increases researchersâ€™ competence and confidence in CI prototyping and workflow development

##### Key Objectives

- **Educational Empowerment:** To provide accessible, high-quality cyber training and hackathons that bridge the gap between traditional water science research and cutting-edge computational methodologies.
- **Research Innovation:** To spearhead the development of open-source machine learning models and cloud computing approaches that can contribute to sustainable water practices.
- **Collaborative Synergy:** To cultivate the workforce that creates, utilizes, and supports advanced CI workflows and tools to enable and potentially transform fundamental water science education and research.
- **Community Engagement:** To broaden the adoption of advanced CI tools and move the larger water science community toward more widely adopting CI approaches.
