## About

**Empowering Water Science Research Through Collaboration**

WaterSoftHack is a multi year NSF funded project, dedicated to advancing water science research through the synergistic power of cyberinfrastructure and machine learning. This initiative is a collaborative effort led by Dr. Vidya Samadi from Clemson University, alongside a consortium of academics from various esteemed institutions.

### Our Vision

At the core of WaterSoftHack lies a vision to democratize access to advanced technological tools and training within the water science community. Our mission is to foster an inclusive academic environment that encourages exploration, innovation, and the sharing of knowledge across borders.

### Key Objectives

- **Educational Empowerment:** To provide accessible, high-quality cyber training and hackathons that bridge the gap between traditional water science research and cutting-edge computational methodologies.
- **Research Innovation:** To spearhead the development of open-source machine learning models that can contribute to sustainable water practices.
- **Collaborative Synergy:** To cultivate a collaborative network of academic institutions, non-profit organizations, and community stakeholders.
- **Community Engagement:** To inspire a new generation of water scientists by promoting interdisciplinary research opportunities.
