This guide provides with basic materials to help you study python on your own.

<!-- ### Refreshing Your Python Skills

If you already have some experience with Python, use the following tutorials to refresh your knowledge:

- [Introduction to Python I](https://clemsonciti.github.io/rcde_workshops/python_programming/01-IntroToPython-I.html)
- [Introduction to Python II](https://clemsonciti.github.io/rcde_workshops/python_programming/02-IntroToPython-II.html)
- [Introduction to Python III](https://clemsonciti.github.io/rcde_workshops/python_programming/03-IntroToPython-III.html)

These resources are not comprehensive but are designed to quickly bring back your existing Python knowledge. -->

### Comprehensive Python Tutorials

For an in-depth study, consider going through the official Python tutorials:

### Visual Learning Resources

If you prefer video tutorials, YouTube offers an abundance of resources. Here are a few examples tailored to different levels of experience:

- **For Those With Programming Experience**  
  [Python for Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU) - A series by Corey Schafer

- **For Complete Beginners**  
  [Harvard CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4) – Full University Course

### Learning Python From Books

For a more structured approach, consider learning Python from a book. There are several good books available online. I personally recommend:

- **Learning Python, 5th Edition by Mark Lutz**  
  This book offers a comprehensive, in-depth introduction to Python, perfect for those who prefer a more traditional method of learning.

### Google Colab

During our training period, we will be using **Python via Google Colab**.  
It is preferable that all participants are at least **familiar with Google Colab** beforehand.

To get started, please walk through the following video playlist for a basic understanding of how Google Colab works:
