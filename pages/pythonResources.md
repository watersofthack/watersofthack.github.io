This guide provides with basic materials to help you study python on your own.

### Refreshing Your Python Skills

If you already have some experience with Python, use the following tutorials to refresh your knowledge:

- [Introduction to Python I](https://clemsonciti.github.io/rcde_workshops/python_programming/01-IntroToPython-I.html)
- [Introduction to Python II](https://clemsonciti.github.io/rcde_workshops/python_programming/02-IntroToPython-II.html)
- [Introduction to Python III](https://clemsonciti.github.io/rcde_workshops/python_programming/03-IntroToPython-III.html)

These resources are not comprehensive but are designed to quickly bring back your existing Python knowledge.

- **For Those With Programming Experience**

### Learning Python From Books

For a more structured approach, consider learning Python from a book. There are several good books available online. I personally recommend:

- **Learning Python, 5th Edition by Mark Lutz**  
  This book offers a comprehensive, in-depth introduction to Python, perfect for those who prefer a more traditional method of learning.

Happy learning!
