## Introduction to Git and GitHub

### What is Git?

Git is a tool(software) that helps keep track of changes made to files. Think of it as a powerful "undo" system, which lets you see what changes were made, when they were made, and by whom. It's very useful for when multiple people are working on the same project as it allows you to merge changes without losing any work. Even if you're working alone, it's very helpful in tracking your own changes, to maintain versions, for experimental work where you have to undo and redo stuffs frequently.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform that hosts your projects online, making it easier for others to collaborate on them. You can think of GitHub as a Dropbox for projects where you can also track changes and work with others. Even as an individual user, you can save a copy of your work, continuously update it and maintain a backup. You can also share your work with others. The projects are stored as repositories. You can have private repository or public repository depending upon whether you want to share your work or keep it to yourself.

#### Key Benefits

- **Track Changes**: Git allows you to maintain a detailed log of what has changed, who changed it, and when it was changed.
- **Collaborate**: GitHub provides a central place for team members to collaborate on projects, review changes, and make improvements together.

- **Manage Changes**: Track and revert changes as needed.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers/members can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicting with each other's changes.

### Uses in Projects
